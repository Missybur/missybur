          <p>For this hackathon we used Thermal technology made by FLIR to make “Thermalgram” an application similar to Instagram, which you can upload “Thelfies(Thermal Selfies)” and people can rate on a scale of 1 - 5 how “hot” they think your picture is and take into account your actual body temperate to give you an average rating through an algorithm that our team created.

          In order to complete this project I used HTML, CSS, mySQL, Javascript, JQuery, Python, Sublime, Git-Hub. Check out the app on thermalgram.com and look out for it on the Android store sometime soon!</p>

          <p>Traveling alone can be a risky business, especially as a women. Being aware of this, the SafeWays team has decided to create a mobile application that would enable women, or any individual interested in the service, to find the safest route from location A to B. How we plan to do this is through scrapping data from various available datasets online that have been published by the local police.</p>

          <p>Have you ever searched for food online and see something delicious that you would like to eat right now?</p>

          <p>Foodgasm is a mobile app that entices user's appeal to food and also helps promote business for local restaurants in the area that have food that is trending on social media. With Foodgasm if you can SEE it you can EAT it!

          We think that this app would be great for businesses because it will direct traffic from social media directly to locations in the area allowing them to have potential business that would not have been made possible without the power of social media images that are online.</p>

          <p>Using the the reddit API, we grabbed the title of the dish desired directly from the reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/) and then used Yelp's API to try and find a restaurant within a 5 mile vicinity of the user's location that would allow the user to purchase the food. For example, if you are viewing sushi dishes online you would be able to click the "checkout" button and the results will come back with a list of restaurants in the area that are within 5 miles of you location, are open and have delivery/pickup options for you to order the food that you would like.</p>
